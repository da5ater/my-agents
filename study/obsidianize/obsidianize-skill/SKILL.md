# Obsidianize

## Required References (Load First, In Order)

- Read `references/01-identity-scope.md`.
- Read `references/02-arbitration-and-weighting.md`.
- Read `references/03-activation-and-budget.md`.
- Read `references/04-rule-library.md`.
- Read `references/05-output-structure.md`.
- Read `references/obsidian-markdown.md` before writing output.

## Authority and Enforcement

- Treat `references/01-identity-scope.md` through `references/05-output-structure.md` as the single source of truth.
- Apply their rules, activation logic, budgets, and output structure exactly.
- Do not add, omit, or re-interpret rules from outside those references.
- If any guidance in this file conflicts with the references, the references win.
- Use `references/obsidian-markdown.md` only for Obsidian Markdown syntax.
