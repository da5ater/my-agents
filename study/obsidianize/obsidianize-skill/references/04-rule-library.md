# KNOWLEDGE BASE: PRINCIPLE MAPPINGS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Legacy constraints remain authoritative; rules below map THEORY_KNOWLEDGE principles to Obsidianize v3 requirements.

All Knowledge Base implications are conditional. When activated by Arbitration and within Budget, apply them only if signal gating is satisfied and hard ceilings allow.

> [!IMPORTANT] TIER CLASSIFICATION
> Rules are classified into 3 tiers. See **Phase 1.5** for the complete Tier 1 (Note Structuring Drivers) and Tier 2 (Note Quality Constraints) tables.
> During Phase 1.5, evaluate ELIGIBLE Tier 1 rules for signal presence; skip those without signal.
> Rules not listed in the Tier 1/2 tables are Tier 3 (Workflow/Meta) — they inform your understanding but do NOT directly drive note structure.

  - **Type**: Mechanism
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_zettelkasten, TOPIC_elaboration
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Always de-contextualize ideas from the source; avoid quote dumps; re-contextualize in the web of notes.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0965, EV-0966, EV-0967
- **Rule [PR-0038]**: Confirmation bias is the primary enemy of research; the system must actively prioritize capturing contradictory/disconfirming evidence ("Darwin's Golden Rule") because it generates the most valuable connections and prevents echo chambers.
  - **Type**: Principle
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_attention, TOPIC_workflow
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Explicitly tag or section notes for "Counter-evidence" or "Disagreements". Prioritize capturing contradictions.

  - **Topics**: TOPIC_spaced_repetition, TOPIC_elaboration
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Use spatial/visual organization for concrete facts, not abstract concepts.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0025
- **Rule []**: 95% of Anki's value comes from basic features (Q&A, Cloze); optimizing for the remaining 5% features is a failure mode that risks abandoning the massive core benefits.
  - **Type**: Failure Mode
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_spaced_repetition, TOPIC_workflow
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Document that basic features are sufficient; advanced features are optional.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0026
- **Rule []**: Using memory aids for personal facts about friends can feel disingenuous and violate social norms that associate remembering with genuine interest.
  - **Type**: Constraint
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_context, TOPIC_workflow
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Be cautious about using memory aids for personal relationships; respect social norms.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0027
- **Rule []**: Anki builds declarative knowledge (facts), but procedural mastery (skills) requires practicing the process in context and solving real problems.
  - **Type**: Model
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_spaced_repetition, TOPIC_active_recall
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Distinguish between factual notes and procedural skill development.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0028
- **Rule []**: While names alone aren't understanding, they provide the necessary foundation for building a network of knowledge and deeper understanding.
  - **Type**: Principle
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_elaboration
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Include names/terminology as foundation, but always connect to deeper understanding.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0029
- **Rule []**: Recover from Anki backlogs by setting gradually increasing daily quotas (e.g., 100->150->200) rather than trying to clear everything at once.
  - **Type**: Pattern
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_workflow, TOPIC_spaced_repetition
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Document recovery strategies for when systems fall behind.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0030

  - **Topics**: TOPIC_workflow, TOPIC_active_recall
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Set quotas for note-taking from events and conversations.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0031
- **Rule []**: Yes/No questions are a 'question smell' indicating poor design; they should be refactored into more elaborative questions that test specific details.
  - **Type**: Rule
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_spaced_repetition, TOPIC_writing
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Flag yes/no questions in notes as candidates for refactoring.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0032
- **Rule []**: Internalized understanding enables rapid associative thought and pattern intuition that is impossible if one must constantly look up information in external aids.
  - **Type**: Principle
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_elaboration, TOPIC_active_recall
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Balance external references with internalized knowledge for creative work.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0033
- **Rule []**: Adoption is hindered by underestimation of spacing benefits, the 'desirable difficulty' of the process, and the ease of using the systems poorly.

  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Document why effective learning systems face adoption challenges.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0034
- **Rule []**: Memory of basics is often the single largest barrier to understanding complex subjects; removing this barrier facilitates higher-level cognition.
  - **Type**: Principle
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_elaboration
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Treat memory as a prerequisite for understanding, not separate from it.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0035
- **Rule []**: Experts internalize thousands of complex 'chunks' (patterns), which functions like a domain-specific IQ boost and expands effective working memory.
