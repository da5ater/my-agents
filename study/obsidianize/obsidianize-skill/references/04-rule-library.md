# KNOWLEDGE BASE: PRINCIPLE MAPPINGS
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Legacy constraints remain authoritative; rules below map THEORY_KNOWLEDGE principles to Obsidianize v3 requirements.

All Knowledge Base implications are conditional. When activated by Arbitration and within Budget, apply them only if signal gating is satisfied and hard ceilings allow.

> [!IMPORTANT] TIER CLASSIFICATION
> Rules are classified into 3 tiers. See **Phase 1.5** for the complete Tier 1 (Note Structuring Drivers) and Tier 2 (Note Quality Constraints) tables.
> During Phase 1.5, evaluate ELIGIBLE Tier 1 rules for signal presence; skip those without signal.
> Rules not listed in the Tier 1/2 tables are Tier 3 (Workflow/Meta) — they inform your understanding but do NOT directly drive note structure.

  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Expect the system to "talk back" by revealing unexpected connections.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0963, EV-0964
- **Rule [PR-0037]**: Notes must strip ideas of their original source context (de-contextualization) and translate them into the user's own language to allow them to be re-embedded into new contexts; copying quotes without this process destroys meaning.
  - **Type**: Mechanism
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_zettelkasten, TOPIC_elaboration
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Always de-contextualize ideas from the source; avoid quote dumps; re-contextualize in the web of notes.
  - **Source EV IDs**: EV-0965, EV-0966, EV-0967
- **Rule [PR-0038]**: Confirmation bias is the primary enemy of research; the system must actively prioritize capturing contradictory/disconfirming evidence ("Darwin's Golden Rule") because it generates the most valuable connections and prevents echo chambers.
  - **Type**: Principle
  - **Topics**: TOPIC_attention, TOPIC_workflow
  - **Implication (obsidian)**: Explicitly tag or section notes for "Counter-evidence" or "Disagreements". Prioritize capturing contradictions.
