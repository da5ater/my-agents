<strong>[this binding]</strong><br>How does `this` resolve in global scope, regular function, method, and arrow function?	Global scope: `this` is global object in non-strict and undefined in strict. Regular function: same as global. Method: `this` is the receiver object. Arrow function: `this` is lexical from enclosing scope.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2Ffunctions%20%2C%20objects%20and%20this%20keyword
<strong>[call/apply/bind]</strong><br>How do `call`, `apply`, and `bind` differ in `this` binding and invocation?	call/apply invoke immediately with a chosen `this`; call takes args list, apply takes args array. bind returns a new function with `this` (and optional preset args) fixed.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2Fcall%2C%20apply%2C%20bind
<strong>[functions vs statements]</strong><br>Why does calling a function expression before assignment fail?	Function expressions are assigned to variables; only the variable is hoisted (as undefined or in TDZ for let/const), so the function value isn't available yet.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2Ffunctions%20%3B%20statements%20vs%20expressions
<strong>[functional mapping]</strong><br>Why use currying to adapt a multi-arg predicate for a unary map helper?	Currying captures extra arguments (like a limit) and returns a unary function so the map callback still receives only the item.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2Ffunctional%20programming
<strong>[composition vs inheritance]</strong><br>Why prefer composition (mixins) over deep inheritance in JavaScript?	Inheritance chains add coupling and complexity; composition lets you assemble behaviors explicitly and keep objects simpler.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fprototypical%20inheritance%2Finheritance%20vs%20composition
<strong>[prototype constructor]</strong><br>Why must you reset `constructor` after `Object.create`?	Object.create sets the child's prototype to a parent object, so the constructor points to the parent unless you reassign it.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fprototypical%20inheritance%2Fresetting%20the%20constructor
<strong>[mixins]</strong><br>How do mixins implement composition in JavaScript?	Copy behavior objects into a target (often with Object.assign) to compose capabilities without inheritance.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fprototypical%20inheritance%2Fmixins
<strong>[method overriding]</strong><br>How do you override a prototype method and call the parent version?	Define the child method on the prototype, then call `Parent.prototype.method.call(this, ...)` inside it.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fprototypical%20inheritance%2Fmethod%20overriding
<strong>[prototypical inheritance]</strong><br>What is the standard pattern to set up inheritance with `Object.create`?	Set `Child.prototype = Object.create(Parent.prototype)` and then reset `Child.prototype.constructor = Child`.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fprototypical%20inheritance%2Fcreating%20your%20own%20prototypical%20inheritance
<strong>[super constructor]</strong><br>Why use `Parent.call(this, ...)` inside a child constructor?	It runs the parent constructor with the child instance as `this`, initializing parent state on the child.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fprototypical%20inheritance%2Fcalling%20the%20super%20constructor
<strong>[private state]</strong><br>How do constructor functions create private properties in JavaScript?	Use local variables (let/const) inside the constructor and access them via privileged methods that close over them.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Fprivate%20property
<strong>[Math object]</strong><br>What does it mean that `Math` is static and how do you get a random number in a range?	`Math` methods are called directly (no instances). Use `Math.random() * (max - min) + min` for a range.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2FJavaScript%20Math%20Object
<strong>[constructor property]</strong><br>What does an object's `constructor` property represent, and why are literals preferred?	It references the function used to create the object; literals are usually cleaner and avoid unnecessary wrapper objects.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2FConstructor%20Functions%20and%20Object%20Creation
<strong>[closure]</strong><br>Why can a method access `computeOptimalLocation` even though it's not on `this`?	Because the method closes over the constructor's lexical environment, so it can access those private variables.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Fclosure
<strong>[closure definition]</strong><br>What is a closure in JavaScript?	A function plus the lexical environment it was created in, retaining access to outer-scope variables after the outer function finishes.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Fclosure%20in%20the%20document
<strong>[object cloning]</strong><br>How do `for...in`, `Object.assign`, and spread clone objects, and what depth do they copy?	All copy enumerable own properties into a new object and are shallow; nested objects are still shared by reference.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2FCloning%20JavaScript%20Objects%20%20Methods%20and%20Techniques
<strong>[this basics]</strong><br>What are three common `this` bindings in JS?	Global/regular function call: global object or undefined in strict; method call: receiver object; constructor call: the new instance.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Ffunctions%2Fthis
<strong>[let vs var]</strong><br>What are the two key differences between `let` and `var`?	`let` is block-scoped and doesn't create a global object property; `var` is function-scoped and does.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Ffunctions%2FLET%20vs%20VAR
<strong>[getters/setters]</strong><br>How do getters and setters change how you access object properties?	You declare `get`/`set` methods and access them like properties (no parentheses), enabling validation and encapsulation.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Ffunctions%2Fgetter%20and%20setter
<strong>[function expressions]</strong><br>How does a function expression differ from a function declaration in hoisting?	Declarations are hoisted with their bodies; expressions are assigned at runtime so calling early fails.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Ffunctions%2Ffunction%20expression
<strong>[error handling]</strong><br>What is the difference between an Error object and an exception, and how do you handle it?	An Error is a plain object; throwing it creates an exception. Wrap risky code in try/catch and validate inputs before throwing.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Ffunctions%2Ferror%20handling
<strong>[default parameters]</strong><br>How can you set default parameter values, and how do you skip a middle default?	Use `arg = arg || default` or `function f(arg = default)`. To skip a middle default, pass `undefined`.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Ffunctions%2Fdefault%20parameters
<strong>[changing this]</strong><br>How do `call`, `apply`, and `bind` differ?	`call` and `apply` invoke immediately with a chosen `this` (apply uses an args array). `bind` returns a new function with `this` fixed.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Ffunctions%2Fchanging%20this
<strong>[arguments and rest]</strong><br>What does the rest operator do and what rule must it follow?	`...args` collects remaining arguments into an array and must be the last parameter.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Ffunctions%2Farguments
<strong>[prototypes]</strong><br>What is the prototype chain in JavaScript?	Objects link to a prototype object; property lookup walks this chain up to Object.prototype.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fprototypes%20and%20prototypical%20inheritance
<strong>[instance vs prototype]</strong><br>Why put methods on the prototype instead of the instance?	Prototype methods are shared across instances, reducing per-object memory use.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fprototype%20vs%20instance%20MEMBERS
<strong>[OOP pillars]</strong><br>What are encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance in JS terms?	Encapsulation bundles data with methods; abstraction hides unnecessary details behind a simpler interface; inheritance reuses behavior via prototypes/classes.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fpillars%20of%20OOP
<strong>[defineProperty]</strong><br>What are data vs accessor descriptors in `Object.defineProperty`?	Data descriptors use `value`/`writable`; accessor descriptors use `get`/`set`. Both share `configurable`/`enumerable`, and you can't mix types.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2FObject.defineProperty%28%29
<strong>[property iteration]</strong><br>How do `Object.keys` and `for...in` differ?	`Object.keys` returns own enumerable properties only; `for...in` iterates own plus enumerable prototype properties.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fiterating%20instance%20vs%20prototype%20members
<strong>[constructor prototype]</strong><br>How are `instance.__proto__` and `Constructor.prototype` related?	They reference the same prototype object used for property lookup.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fconstructor%20prototype
<strong>[class this]</strong><br>How does `this` differ between method calls and detached function calls?	Method calls bind `this` to the receiver; detached calls use global/undefined, and class methods default to undefined in strict mode.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fclass%2Fthis
<strong>[static methods]</strong><br>What are static methods and where do you call them?	Static methods live on the class itself and are not available on instances.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fclass%2Fstatic%20methods
<strong>[private class data]</strong><br>How do Symbols and WeakMaps emulate private state in classes?	Symbols create non-enumerable, hard-to-guess keys; WeakMaps store data keyed by instance, keeping it inaccessible without the map.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fclass%2Fprivate%20property
<strong>[array testing]</strong><br>What do `every` and `some` test on arrays?	`every` returns true if all elements pass the predicate; `some` returns true if any element passes.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Farrays%2Ftesting%20arrays
<strong>[global symbols]</strong><br>What does `Symbol.for` provide?	It returns a symbol from the global registry, so the same key yields the same symbol across modules.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fglobal%20symbols
<strong>[classes under the hood]</strong><br>What is a JavaScript class under the hood?	A class is a function with a prototype; instances' `__proto__` points to the class prototype.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fclasses%2Funder%20the%20hood
<strong>[type checks]</strong><br>Why is `typeof null` misleading and how can you detect arrays or functions?	`typeof null` is a known bug. Use `Object.prototype.toString.call(x)` or `Array.isArray` for arrays.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fodds%20and%20ends
<strong>[Object.create]</strong><br>What does `Object.create(proto)` do?	It creates a new object whose prototype is `proto`.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2FOOP%2FObject.create%28%29
<strong>[function constructor]</strong><br>What does the `new` keyword do with a function constructor?	Creates a new object, binds `this` to it, sets its prototype, runs the function, and returns the object.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2FOOP%2Ffunction%20constructor
<strong>[prototype vs scope]</strong><br>How does the prototype chain differ from the scope chain?	Prototype chain resolves properties on objects; scope chain resolves variables by lexical scope.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2FOOP%2Fprototypical%20inheritance
<strong>[scoping]</strong><br>What is lexical scoping and the scope chain in JS?	Scope is determined by code placement; the scope chain is the set of parent scopes a function can access.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fjonas%2Finternals%2Fscoping%20and%20the%20scope%20chain
<strong>[closure + loops]</strong><br>Why do `var` loop closures log the same value, and how do you fix it?	`var` is function-scoped so all closures share one variable; use `let` or an IIFE to capture each value.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2Fclosures
<strong>[IIFE]</strong><br>Why use an IIFE?	To create an isolated scope immediately and avoid leaking variables into the global scope.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2FIIFEs
<strong>[value vs reference]</strong><br>How are primitives and objects passed to functions?	Primitives are copied by value; objects are passed by reference (the reference is copied), so mutations are shared.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2Fpass%20by%20value%20vs%20pass%20by%20reference
<strong>[functions are objects]</strong><br>What does it mean that functions are objects in JS?	Functions can have properties/methods and are invocable, so they behave like objects with callable code.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2Ffunctions%20are%20object
<strong>[JSON]</strong><br>How does JSON differ from object literals and how do you convert?	JSON is a strict subset using double-quoted keys/strings; use `JSON.parse` and `JSON.stringify`.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2FJSON
<strong>[property access]</strong><br>When should you use bracket notation instead of dot notation?	Use brackets for dynamic keys or keys with spaces/special characters; both access object properties.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fobjects%20and%20functions%2Fthe%20dot
<strong>[comparison coercion]</strong><br>Why is `3 < 2 < 1` true, and how do you avoid surprises?	Left-to-right: `3 < 2` is false, then `false < 1` coerces to 0 < 1. Avoid mixed-type comparisons and use strict equality.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Ftypes%20and%20operators%2Fcomparsion
<strong>[coercion]</strong><br>What is type coercion in JavaScript?	Automatic conversion between types, e.g. `1 + "2"` becomes string concatenation.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Ftypes%20and%20operators%2Fcoercion
<strong>[operators]</strong><br>What do operator precedence and associativity describe?	Precedence decides which operator runs first; associativity decides evaluation order when precedence is equal.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Ftypes%20and%20operators%2Foperators
<strong>[types]</strong><br>What is dynamic typing and what are JS primitive types?	Types are determined at runtime. Primitives: undefined, null, boolean, number, string, symbol.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Ftypes%20and%20operators%2Ftypes
<strong>[event loop]</strong><br>How does the event loop execute async callbacks in single-threaded JS?	The browser queues events; the engine processes the event queue only when the call stack is empty.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fasynchronous%20callbacks
<strong>[scope chain]</strong><br>Why does a function use the variable from its definition scope instead of call site?	Because scope is lexical; the function's outer environment is fixed by where it was defined.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fthe%20scope%20chain
<strong>[variable environment]</strong><br>What is a variable environment in an execution context?	It is the memory space for variables and functions for that context, separate per call.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Ffunction%2C%20context%20and%20variable%20environment
<strong>[execution context]</strong><br>What happens when a function is invoked?	A new execution context is created and pushed onto the call stack; it's popped when the function returns.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2FFUNCTION%20INVOCATION%20AND%20THE%20EXECUTION%20CONTEXT
<strong>[single-threaded]</strong><br>What does single-threaded, synchronous execution mean in JS?	Only one task runs at a time in order; later work waits until the current call stack clears.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fsingle%20threader%20synchronous%20execution
<strong>[execution phase]</strong><br>What is the execution phase of an execution context?	The engine runs the code line by line using the variables/functions prepared during creation.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fcode%20execution
<strong>[undefined vs not defined]</strong><br>What is the difference between `undefined` and `not defined`?	`undefined` is a value for declared but uninitialized variables; `not defined` is a ReferenceError for undeclared identifiers.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fundefined
<strong>[hoisting]</strong><br>What is hoisting during the creation phase?	Function declarations are fully stored; variable declarations are allocated and initialized to undefined.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fcreation%20and%20hoisting
<strong>[global object]</strong><br>How are global variables related to the global object?	In the global execution context, `this` points to the global object and `var`/function declarations become its properties.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fthe%20global%20environment%20and%20global%20object
<strong>[name-value pairs]</strong><br>What is a name-value pair and how do objects use it?	A name maps to a value; objects are collections of these pairs.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fname-value%20pairs%20and%20objects
<strong>[syntax parser]</strong><br>What is a syntax parser and a lexical environment?	The parser reads and validates code; lexical environment is where code is physically written, which determines scope relationships.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Funderstanding%20js%20the%20weird%20parts%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment%2Fsyntax%20parser%2C%20execution%20context%20and%20lexical%20environment
<strong>[higher-order functions]</strong><br>What is a higher-order function?	A function that takes a function as input or returns a function.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fjonas%2Ffunctions
<strong>[destructuring]</strong><br>What is destructuring and why use it?	It extracts values from arrays/objects into variables concisely, with support for defaults and renaming.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fjonas%2Fmodern%20operators%20and%20data%20structures%2Fmodern%20operators
<strong>[this rules]</strong><br>How is `this` determined in JavaScript?	By call-site: method call uses receiver, simple call uses undefined/window, arrow uses lexical `this`, event handler uses element.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fjonas%2Finternals%2Fthis
<strong>[hoisting internals]</strong><br>What happens to declarations before execution starts?	The engine creates a variable environment and registers declarations, enabling hoisting.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fjonas%2Finternals%2FVariable%20Environment%20Hoisting%20and%20The%20TDZ
<strong>[call stack]</strong><br>What are the key parts of an execution context and what does the call stack do?	Execution context holds variable environment, scope chain, and `this`; call stack tracks active contexts.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fjonas%2Finternals%2Fexecution%20context%20and%20the%20call%20stack
<strong>[JS engine]</strong><br>What are the call stack and heap in a JS engine?	Call stack tracks execution contexts; heap stores objects and memory allocations.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fjonas%2Finternals%2FJs%20engine

High-level, dynamic, prototype-based, garbage-collected, single-threaded with an event loop and first-class functions.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fjonas%2Finternals%2Fhigh%20level%20overview%20of%20JS
<strong>[dynamic objects]</strong><br>What does it mean that JS objects are dynamic?	You can add/remove properties and methods at runtime; `const` prevents reassignment but not mutation.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Fdynamic%20nature%20of%20objects
<strong>[constructor vs factory]</strong><br>How do constructor and factory functions differ?	Constructors use `new` and `this` (often PascalCase); factories return an object directly without `new`.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Fconstructor%20functions
<strong>[array sorting]</strong><br>How does the comparator function in `Array.sort` determine order?	Return a negative value for a before b, 0 for equal, positive for after.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Farrays%2Fsorting%20an%20array
<strong>[prototype chain levels]</strong><br>How does multilevel inheritance work for built-ins like arrays?	Arrays inherit from Array.prototype, which in turn inherits from Object.prototype, forming a chain.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2FOOP%2Fmulti%20level%20inheritance
<strong>[value vs reference]</strong><br>How do value and reference types behave on assignment?	Primitives copy the value; objects/arrays copy the reference, so both variables point to the same object.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Fpass%20by%20value%20VS%20pass%20by%20reference
<strong>[slice vs concat]</strong><br>What is the difference between `slice` and `concat`/spread for arrays?	`slice` copies a portion (shallow) into a new array; `concat`/spread combine arrays into a new array.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Farrays%2Fcombinning%20and%20slicing%20arrays
<strong>[array iteration]</strong><br>What is a key difference between `for...of` and `forEach`?	`for...of` supports break/continue and async control flow; `forEach` does not.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Farrays%2Fiterating%20an%20array
<strong>[find vs includes]</strong><br>Why does `includes` fail for object literals and how do you search objects?	`includes` checks reference equality; use `find`/`findIndex` with a predicate for object properties.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Farrays%2Ffinding%20elements%20%28primitive%29%20and%20%28reference%29
<strong>[adding array elements]</strong><br>How do you add elements to the end, start, or middle of an array?

<strong>[Date object]</strong><br>What are common ways to create a Date and what is special about the month index?	`new Date()` for now, `new Date(string)` or `new Date(ms)` for a specific time, `new Date(y, m, d...)` uses 0-based months.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2FDate%20Object
<strong>[String primitives]</strong><br>How do string primitives differ from `String` objects?	Primitives are type string; `new String` creates an object wrapper. JS auto-boxes primitives to access methods.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2FJavaScript%20String%20Object
<strong>[garbage collection]</strong><br>What does the JS garbage collector do and can you control it?	It automatically frees memory for unreachable objects; you cannot directly control when it runs.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Fgarbage%20collection
<strong>[enumerating properties]</strong><br>What are common ways to enumerate properties and check existence?	Use `for...in`, `Object.keys`, `Object.entries`, and the `in` operator to check property presence.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2FEnumerating%20Properties%20in%20JavaScript%20Objects
<strong>[functions as objects]</strong><br>What does it imply that functions are objects and how are they created?	Functions have properties/methods like any object and are created via the Function constructor under the hood.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Ffunctions%20are%20objects
<strong>[factory functions]</strong><br>What problem do factory functions solve and what do they return?	They create configurable objects without `new`, returning an object literal with the desired properties and methods.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Ffactory%20functions
<strong>[object basics]</strong><br>What is an object literal used for in JS?	It groups related data and behavior as key-value pairs, often including methods.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Fobjects%2Fbaiscs
<strong>[removing array elements]</strong><br>How do you remove elements from arrays and quickly empty one?	Use `pop`, `shift`, or `splice` to remove; set `length = 0` or splice all items to empty.	obsidian://open?vault=mohamed&file=programming%2Fjavascript%2Fcod%20with%20mosh%2Fbasics%2Farrays%2Fremoving%20elements
