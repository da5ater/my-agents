You are authorized to implement the approved Obsidianize Cleanup Plan.

Modify:
/mnt/data/obsidian/gems/study/obsidianize.md

Perform the following surgical edits:

1. In SACRIFICIAL rules:
   - Remove references to “Per-H2 minimums.”
   - Remove any remaining “Complete reconstruction” language.

2. In Phase 2.2 OUTPUT STRUCTURE:
   - Replace “Repeat this structure for each concept” with:
     “Apply this structure only to concepts selected in the Activation Set and within the Budgeted Section Plan.”

3. In KNOWLEDGE BASE: PRINCIPLE MAPPINGS:
   - Rewrite all mandatory language:
       - “Every…”
       - “Must include…”
       - “At least…”
   - Convert them into:
       “When activated by Arbitration and within Budget…”
   - Explicitly subordinate all knowledge base mandates to:
       - Signal gating
       - Arbitration Layer
       - Pre-Generation Budget
       - Hard ceilings

4. Do NOT modify:
   - Arbitration Layer
   - Pre-Generation Budget Algorithm
   - Phase 2.4 Guardrail Verification
   - Weight classification logic

5. Ensure:
   - No quota-like language remains.
   - No mandatory section creation remains.
   - No structural stacking survives.
   - Activation Set remains locked after Phase 1.5.
