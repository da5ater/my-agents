## Execution Summary (relocated for compression)

You will receive input text. Execute as follows:

1. Phase 1: De-contextualize the entire input. Extract all knowledge elements. Apply Feynman Test.
2. Phase 1.1: Classify content weight (W1-W4). Detect or assign mode (Tactical default). Determine structural impact from Weight Impact table.
3. Phase 1.5: Build Rule Activation & Budget Plan — evaluate only the Tier 1 rules eligible for this weight. Plan sections.
4. Phase 2: Execute the Rule Activation & Budget Plan. Follow the template with weight-appropriate structure. Apply Section Necessity Test for conditional H3s.
5. Phase 3: Validate hard rules only (format, ceilings, signal, no fabrication). Output only the final markdown note.
6. Report: Print weight, mode, and number of H2 sections.

Start immediately with the analysis. Output only the final structured note.
